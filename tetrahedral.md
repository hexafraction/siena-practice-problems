## Problem statement:

We know very well that triangular numbers (or 2-simplex-numbers) are those in the form of `1+2+...+n` (such that the n-th triangular number is the sum of the first n positive integers). Consider tetrahedral numbers (or 3-simplex-numbers), where the n-th tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.

For a given value of `2<=m<=5` and `1<=n<=20`, find the n-th m-simplex number.

## Testcases:

Input:

```
3 4
```

Output:

```
20
```

Input:

```
5 2
