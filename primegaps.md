## Problem statement:

The number of composite numbers between two consecutive primes is called a prime gap. Given a large prime, find the prime gap between it and the next prime. The algorithm must be as efficient as possible, since it will be used with extremely large primes.

## Testcases:

Input:

```
3
```

Output:

```
1
```

(only composite between 3 and 5 is 4)

Input:

```
155921
```

Output:

```
85
```
